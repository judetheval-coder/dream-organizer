# Dream Organizer - Local AI Configuration

# No API keys required! This app runs completely locally using your SD server.
# The SD server runs on http://localhost:3001

# Optional: If you want to use external APIs instead of local generation,
# you can add tokens here (not recommended for this setup):

# HuggingFace Inference API (FREE - 1000 requests/month)
# HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Note: By default, all generation happens locally through your SD server.
# This ensures privacy and no usage limits.
